Description: 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data analysis process, allowing us to understand the underlying patterns, detect anomalies, and test hypotheses using statistical summaries and graphical representations. Below are the key steps involved in EDA for our dataset:

Steps Involved in EDA Data Collection and Loading:
Importing the dataset into the analysis environment (e.g., using pandas in Python). Inspecting the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure using head(). Data Cleaning:

Handling missing values: 
Identifying and addressing missing data points using techniques like imputation or deletion. Removing duplicates: Ensuring no repeated entries that could skew the analysis. Correcting data types: Ensuring all columns have appropriate data types (e.g., converting strings to dates). Data Summary:

Generating summary statistics: 
Using describe() to get an overview of numerical columns. Examining categorical variables: Understanding the distribution of categorical features. Data Visualization:

Univariate analysis: 
Visualizing individual variables using histograms, box plots, and bar charts to understand their distribution and identify outliers. Bivariate analysis: Exploring relationships between pairs of variables using scatter plots, correlation matrices, and heatmaps. Multivariate analysis: Investigating interactions among three or more variables using pair plots, 3D scatter plots, or parallel coordinate plots.

Conclusion: 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a pivotal step in the data analysis process, providing essential insights into the dataset. Through EDA, we identified key patterns, trends, and relationships, as well as addressed missing values and outliers. Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps facilitated a deeper understanding of the data's structure. These preliminary analyses and feature engineering efforts ensured that the data was clean, well-prepared, and suitable for building predictive models. Ultimately, EDA set the foundation for more accurate and reliable analytical outcomes, guiding subsequent modeling and decision-making processes.
